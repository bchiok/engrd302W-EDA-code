data1 %>% 
  select("Geography Name","Sits in State.x", "GeoID.x", "Average Annual Dollars per Person Spent on Medical Care", "Data Time Period.x", "Sits in State.y", )

```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
